# Churn Modeling - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This is a beginner-friendly project focused on exploring and preparing a customer churn dataset for machine learning modeling. The project is structured in sequential notebooks that address common steps in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and preprocessing.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice core data preparation techniques, including:

- Identifying and handling missing values
- Detecting and addressing outliers
- Building a clean and model-ready dataset step-by-step

Each stage is documented in separate, clearly numbered Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Pydantic
- groq (LLM API)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (planned for modeling)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- '0_handle_missing_values.ipynb' â€“ missing value detection and imputation

- '1_handle_outliers.ipynb' â€“ outlier detection and treatment (WIP)

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Complete full preprocessing pipeline
- Train a machine learning model to predict churn
- Evaluate and iterate on model performance
