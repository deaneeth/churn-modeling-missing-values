# Churn Modeling - Missing Values Handling

This is a simple beginner-level project focused on handling missing values in a customer churn dataset.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The main goal of this task was to practice basic data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, particularly:
- Identifying missing/NULL values
- Predicting missing gender using a language model (LLM)
- Dropping unnecessary columns

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Pydantic
- groq (LLM API)

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

- Loaded a churn dataset with missing values in `Firstname`, `Lastname`, and `Gender`
- Used an LLM to predict gender based on first and last names
- Filled in missing gender values
- Dropped columns not needed for modeling (`RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Firstname`, `Lastname`)

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `churn_cleaning.ipynb` â€“ main notebook with all code
- `README.md` â€“ this file

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add more preprocessing (e.g., feature scaling, encoding)
- Build a churn prediction model
- Evaluate model performance
